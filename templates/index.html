        <h4>About Site</h4>
        <p>
            The PG Booking Management System is designed to simplify and automate the process 
            of booking PG and hostel rooms. Students can browse available properties, book rooms, 
            track booking approvals, check-in status, and make payments securely.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other side, Property Owners can manage their PG listings, approve booking 
            requests, monitor room occupancy, and review payment history from students.
